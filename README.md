# Employee Timesheet
This is an open-source online timesheet for freelance workers. It allows them to record their hours their rates after a job has been done. 

## Motivation
I work for a start-up that hired a lot of freelance IT engineers and one thing I realized was how difficult it was to collect their hours after their work was done. Each individual had to send in their own spreadhsheet with their hours and it was pretty much a big hassle. So, I decided to streamlines things a bit for them and create this. I also felt it would be useful for anyone who needs it.
